# Introduction

In this Course, we will start from the ground up checking everything that we need to start programming. In the first Classes we will see the foundation and how python works. Later we will create a simple program from scratch, and as we learn new concepts, we will move into some more advanced topics, and we will work with more advanced projects. At the end, we will create a complete program for a store, including adding customers, products, and selling the merchandise for the client.

# What is needed?

To Follow this course, You will need a computer with internet access, and motivation to keep working on the projects that are hard. Since we are using python, we don't need to install the interpreter, environment, editor, etc.. on our machine. Although this will be required for development later, it will not be needed for the course. To follow the classes and do the tasks, you can use and online editor. I recommend using [repl.it](https://repl.it/), because you can clone some repositories to start working, but any editor/compiler will work. If you already have python installed on your machine, like in a Linux Operational system, you can download or clone the classes and work on your own machine.

# Where are the classes?

The classes are located on [github](https://github.com/orgs/cz-python-course), and you can follow, fork, clone the repositories as you want.
When you fork the class, you will have the following structure:

- Readme.md
- main.py
- examples/
- exercises/

I adopted this Layout because it will make it easier for [repl.it](http://repl.it) to import it and set up the project.

## Readme.md

This is the main file for the class, and you should always start reading the information here. Here you will find the information about the class, concepts, tutorials,etc... This file will be your guide in this course.

## main.py

This file is the main file that you will execute on repl.it. You can run it to check the examples.

Due to limitations on repl.it, this file will only contain a menu asking which example you want to run. In this case, you will have to check the example file to check what is being executed. The file will be available in the repository as well. You will find the examples inside the 'examples' folder.

To complete the exercises, you will be asked to modify some files. These files will be inside the 'exercises' folder. The main.py will be prepared to ask you which files you want to execute. In this way, you only have to change the files you will work with, but when you execute, the menu will ask you which file you want to run.

# Getting started

There are multiple ways to start studying. You can choose your own editor and clone the repositories, or choose an online editor and compiler, for example. In this course we will guide you on how to use repl.it to follow the classes.

## Using repl.it

The first thing you will need to do is create a repl.it account. This is necessary so you can save your work.
***Disclaimer:*** In the free version you only have access to public repositories, which means everyone can see your code. For this reason do not add passwords, emails, logins, etc. Even if you delete it later, repl.it has a history of what was typed, and the information may be still available.

Since the Account creation may change during the time, we will not get in details about it. But, if you have an Github account, you can log in using that authentication.

When you log in, you will see the dashboard, where you will be able to see all your projects and repositories. In the top of the screen you will see a "+ new repl" button. This will create a new project for you. 
Inside every project, you can have as many files as you want. For each class you will need to create a new project.

### Cloning a project from github

Since all our classes are available on github, you can clone directly. Let's check every option you have to fill in order to clone a class to your repl.it

- Language
  - In this Course we will use "Python", as it creates a repository with a python 3 interpreter
- github link
  - Here you can paste the link for the github repository. For this class, the link would be https://github.com/cz-python-course/Class0
- Name Your repl
  - This will be automatically filled when you input a github link for the class
- Description (optional)
  - In case you want to add some extra description for the repl.

Then you can click on "Import from Github" to start the cloning process. Once this is done, repl will open the project for you.
